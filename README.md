# flutter-flake

This project is deprecated, please use [nix-flutter-flake](https://github.com/AtaraxiaSjel/nix-flutter-flake)

## Description

This is a flake that configures Flutter for you.

It was created because I hated configuring Android for Flutter. It’s currently mostly made to do that.

Feel free to open a PR if you want to add MacOS support or something.

This isn’t well tested. If you’re a flutter developer, please report any (potentially glaringly obvious) problems.

(Also, this doesn’t work. Not even close.)
